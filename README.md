The entire point of this project is to simply mirror http://letsgooutside.org/activities/ onto Google Calendar.
If you just want to add the calendar the mirror is live at #TODO: add link to public calendar :ODOT#

If you want to run your own version (perhaps for your own local website) then read on.

This project requires you have a google API key.

If you have one already you should put in the secrets directory like so
$ ln -s ~/Dropbox/AppSecrets/openspace secrets


You also need to specify a calendar to create/use like so...
#TODO: add instructions :ODOT#
